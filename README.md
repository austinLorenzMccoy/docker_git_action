# Docker GitHub Actions Demo

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Docker with GitHub Actions for automated containerization and deployment of a machine learning project.

## Overview

This project showcases how to:
- Build Docker images automatically using GitHub Actions
- Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for containerized applications
- Manage Docker builds in an automated workflow

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine
- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of Docker and GitHub Actions

## Project Structure

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dockeraction

2. Local Docker Build:
docker build -t your-image-name .

3. Run the container locally:
docker run -it your-image-name

GitHub Actions Workflow
The workflow is configured to:

```
Trigger on push events to main branch

Build the Docker image

Run tests (if configured)

Push to container registry (if configured)
```

To use this workflow:

```
Configure repository secrets if needed

Push changes to trigger the workflow

Monitor the Actions tab in your GitHub repository


### Configuration
#### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile contains the instructions to build your container image. Ensure it's properly configured for your application needs.

GitHub Actions Configuration
The workflow configuration is located in .github/workflows/docker.yml

Contributing
Fork the repository

Create your feature branch ( git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature)

Commit your changes ( git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature')

Push to the branch ( git push origin feature/amazing-feature)

Open a Pull Request

Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

Check Docker daemon is running for local builds

Verify GitHub Actions permissions

Ensure all required secrets are configured
